CHAPTER 6 EXERCISES:


2a) 

Catalyst Wars:

* Too much explanation for the basics of the game

* Not in a GDD format, its hard to follow since theres no table of contents or
chapter numbers for each section either.

* No target audience

* Missing schedule and budget

* Illustrations / Art Missing

* No Control Schemes


Flying:

* Lacks story and character descriptions, meld them into
game mechanics instead...

* No Table of Contents

* Typos

* Why is there a Walkthrough...?

* Descriptions are terrible, especially the object and story ones

* Also lack specific names for characters



2b)

Claw:

* Table of contents included, organization is key for easy readability

* Includes elements added over the course of development. 

* User controls being added shows that you have a good idea on the gameplay

* Shows items and UI elements that will be in the game with illustrations for each one.

* Levels are organized separately from each other and the enemies are nicely grouped with them.

* States a target audience. Knowing who to market your game to is key to meet target sales.


DOOM: 

* Table of contents is included here too, organization helps to make the document easier 
to read.

* Story elements and others are grouped into their own respective Episodes / Levels
Keeps sections concise and refrains from making a huge body of text for the whole story.

* Character descriptions are detailed and provide enough information for the person reading.



2c)

Pole Position:

* A basic gameplay description seems to have always been necessary for selling a game in a GDD.

* Descriptions for all the game's different game systems still exists in this document.


* A table of contents is missing from this document, although the document is way less lengthy
than the modern ones and the inter-office memo takes up a majority of it.

* Illustrations are missing

* The target audience is missing

* The story description is missing.

* The document should include anything about the levels / map of the game.

* Missing appendices.

* Missing objects, items, and UI along with descriptions for them.

* Missing controls.



* Seems to include an inter-office memo at the end of the document that includes any problems the development
and production teams had.

* Game systems, modes, and hardware requirements seem to be the maximum of what should've been included in 
a GDD at the game for both documents.
