CHAPTER 1 QUESTIONS:


1)

* Mattel:
They stopped trying to compete in the video game market after the release of the Intellivision 2.
The video game crash along with the releases from other competitors led to a very small market
share for an already shrinking market...


* Coleco:
The Colecovision was a home console that sold surprisingly well with a bunch of recreations of 
arcade titles. However, the console had an expansion which allowed Atari 2600 games to be played
as well as released an Atari clone called the Gemini. This led to Atari eventually suing the company
in which they actually lost... Along with the video game crash, Coleco slowly died out over the years.


2)

They were both top competitors that competed in the video game and console markets at the time with the same 
kind of architecture and firmware.


3)

 They're too stubborn and won't back down to their competitors (Mostly Nintendo at the time).
