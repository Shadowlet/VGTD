CHAPTER 3 EXERCISES:

1)

Concept:
	Physics 2-D Golf Game with Levels

Story:
	Around the Medival Times, a parent tasks their son with an errand that requires them
to fetch some crystals in a newfound ruin. He only expected the errand to take the whole
day but realizes his son hasn't returned yet.. The father travels to the ruins the next day to
find his son. As he walks inside there is a magic golf club awaiting him in the first room.
In his head he hears the words of the supposed Master of the ruins he was tresspassing.
"If you want to find you son, you must first complete the challenges ahead with this magic
golf club." it says. The father is determined to rescue his son from the mastermind and starts
his quest.

Non-Linear Story:
	Around the Medival Times, a parent tasks their son with an errand that requires them
to fetch some crystals in a newfound ruin. He only expected the errand to take the whole
day but realizes his son hasn't returned yet.. The father being the lazy and unappreciative 
father figure he could be, he decides he can do something else instead. So now the father had to
either choose to rescue his son or stay home.


	CHOICE ONE:
		The father travels to the ruins the next day to
	find his son. As he walks inside there is a magic golf club awaiting him in the first room.
	In his head he hears the words of the supposed Master of the ruins he was tresspassing.
	"If you want to find you son, you must first complete the challenges ahead with this magic
	golf club." it says. The father is determined to rescue his son from the mastermind and starts
	his quest.

	CHOICE TWO:
		After making his descision to stay home, the master of the ruins who is keeping his son hostage
	praises the father and rewards him with a magic golf club which can shoot any golf ball as far 
	as the eye can see. The ruin master teleports him to a special golf course so that he could use this
	golf club.


2a)

	Choice One:

		If the player chooses to go rescue the son, they are tasked with completing a set of level which
	are rigged with traps and frustrating obstacles since they are trespassing in the ruins.

	Choice Two:

		If the player chooses to play the other golf course if they don't go to rescue the son. They will
	play through an easier golf course as if they are playing mini-golf. These levels do not have any
	traps or obstacles inside and instead give the player fun levels that properly use the game's mechanics.


	* Both choices have their own respective stories and endings.


2b)

	Choice One requires more strategy in order to complete the levels while Choice Two mostly requires no thought,
		although the player will lose later on as the difficulty does indeed increase.
	What I have thought of so far for the ruin level are timed spike traps and lava pits. Later on there will
	be moving enemies that the player has to avoid touching or else the ball will explode.


3) This is a 2-D golf game with downward's gravity, this means that the golf ball will stay on a floor or wall depending
on the level. Like a platformer, the player has to steer the golf ball towards a goal in order to complete each level. There will be collectibles as the levels will pretty much play and look like a platformer. These sources aren't required to 
beat the game and are entirely optional. There will be a limited amount of turns much like regular golf and requires the player to start over if they fail, losing all of their collectibles. No such converter will exist.

This would be one of the first levels where the player is taught about ramps. After the first jump
they see how going down a ramp works as well as the stop they encounter in the pit. The collectibles
are just meant to be a guide that the player should follow and they can grab them without any effort.
After the last jump they get some relief and slide down a long ramp with a lot of coins and roll into the hole.

Choice one will consist of linear layouts while the other choice will use parallel layouts.
The ruin levels will consist of blue and black colour pallets for the background and walls while the golf ball
will be white and the collectible coins will be gold-yellow. The objects in the level should contrast from the 
background and walls.

Choice two will have more greenish bluish backgrounds and walls and give you more exploration in the levels instead
of a straight path like above. There will be collectibles scattered all around the levels and the game rewards you with
more points if you happen to collect all of them in a level.
