Considering Angry Birds is a simple physics based game, it would need to pass a verification test
after the initial implementation to see if the gameplay is meeting standards. In this case the 
Agile Development Model should be chosen over the Waterfall Model. The agile model compared to the 
waterfall one can go back a step if the unit tests do not pass inspection or shareholders are not
pleased. Agile development focuses on immediate design implementation as the costs of development
also does not increase overtime throughout the project. An agile framework used in this method is 
called SCRUM. Teams are 5-9 members and no more, remaining members are put into other teams which helps
make communication and efficiency easier for a mobile game project like this.
